  "story_text": "Easter morning arrived at Sage Farm with golden sunshine streaming through the windows. Luna, the playful black puppy, bounced out of her cozy bed, her tail wagging with excitement. Today was special—the Easter Bunny had visited!\n\nLuna raced to the garden where colorful Easter eggs were hidden among the flowers. But as she searched under the rosebushes, she realized something terrible had happened. Her favorite red ball, the one she carried everywhere, was missing!\n\n'My ball!' Luna whimpered, looking around frantically. 'Where could it be?'\n\nHeidi, the spotted German Shorthaired Pointer, trotted over with mud still on her paws from her morning swim in the pond. 'What's wrong, Luna?' she asked, shaking droplets from her long ears.\n\n'I can't find my red ball anywhere!' Luna cried. 'I had it yesterday when we were playing in the meadow.'\n\nRandy, the big fluffy white Samoyed, bounded over with his characteristic smile. 'Don't worry, little friend! We'll help you find it. That's what family does—we stick together!'\n\nJust then, Morphée the calico cat appeared, gracefully leaping down from her favorite perch in the old oak tree. Her mismatched patches of orange, white, and black fur gleamed in the morning sun. 'Did someone say they needed help?' she purred. 'I saw everything from up in my tree yesterday.'\n\n'You did?' Luna's ears perked up hopefully.\n\n'I saw you playing with your ball near the chicken coop,' Morphée said thoughtfully, licking her paw. 'But then the wind picked up, and I saw something red rolling toward the vegetable garden.'\n\nThe four friends set off together toward the vegetable garden. Heidi used her excellent nose to sniff for Luna's scent, while Randy's height allowed him to peer over the tall corn stalks. Morphée climbed the garden fence to get a bird's-eye view, and Luna searched under every lettuce leaf and behind every tomato plant.\n\n'I found something!' Heidi called out, her tail pointing straight as she froze near the carrot patch. But when they rushed over, it was only a red tomato that had fallen from its vine.\n\n'Keep looking,' Randy encouraged. 'We won't give up on you, Luna.'\n\nThey searched the barn next, with Morphée checking the high hay bales and Randy sniffing around the horse stalls. Heidi splashed through a muddy puddle (which she quite enjoyed), thinking the ball might have rolled there, while Luna looked in every corner.\n\nStill no ball.\n\n'Maybe we should check the meadow where you were playing yesterday,' suggested Morphée. 'Sometimes things hide in the tall grass.'\n\nThe friends trotted out to the wide meadow behind the farmhouse. The spring grass was indeed quite tall, and searching seemed impossible. But Randy had an idea.\n\n'Everyone spread out!' he barked. 'We'll walk in a line across the meadow. That way, we won't miss anything.'\n\nSo they formed a search line: Heidi with her nose to the ground, Luna looking carefully through the grass, Randy using his height to spot anything red, and Morphée darting ahead to investigate suspicious spots.\n\nThey had walked almost halfway across the meadow when Morphée suddenly yowled with excitement. 'Over here! I found something!'\n\nThe others rushed over to see Morphée sitting next to a small burrow. And there, just barely visible in the entrance, was a flash of red.\n\n'It's my ball!' Luna yipped with joy. But then she paused. 'But it's stuck in there. How will I get it out?'\n\nHeidi stepped forward. 'My paws are smaller than yours, Randy, and I'm good at digging. Let me try.' She carefully began to widen the burrow entrance with her paws.\n\n'Wait,' said Morphée suddenly. 'I hear something.'\n\nThey all listened carefully. From deep in the burrow came tiny squeaking sounds.\n\n'Oh my!' Luna gasped. 'There are baby animals in there! We can't disturb them.'\n\nThe friends looked at each other, then at the burrow. Luna's ball was so close, but they couldn't risk hurting the baby rabbits that had made their home there.\n\n'You know what, Luna?' Randy said gently. 'Sometimes the most important thing isn't getting what we want, but making sure others are safe and happy.'\n\nLuna looked at her beloved ball, then at her friends, then back at the burrow. Slowly, she nodded. 'The baby bunnies need their home more than I need my ball right now.'\n\n'That's very brave and kind of you,' Heidi said, nuzzling Luna affectionately.\n\nAs they turned to head home, disappointed but proud of doing the right thing, they heard a rustling in the grass behind them. They turned to see a large rabbit emerging from a different burrow nearby.\n\n'Thank you,' the rabbit said in a gentle voice. 'I'm the Easter Bunny, and those are my grandchildren in that burrow. I saw how kind you were to put their safety first.'\n\nThe friends' eyes grew wide with amazement. The real Easter Bunny!\n\n'Because you showed such kindness and worked so well together,' the Easter Bunny continued, 'I have something for you.' He hopped over to a nearby bush and retrieved Luna's red ball. 'This rolled away from their burrow entrance yesterday. I was saving it to return to its owner—someone who truly deserves it.'\n\nLuna's tail wagged so hard her whole body wiggled. 'Thank you! But how did you know it was mine?'\n\nThe Easter Bunny winked. 'I've been watching you all play together. I see how you share your toys, how you help each other, and how you just put others' needs before your own. That's the true spirit of Easter—caring for one another.'\n\nAs the Easter Bunny hopped away, the four friends walked home together, Luna happily carrying her red ball. But more importantly, they carried the warm feeling of having worked as a team and done the right thing.\n\n'You know what?' Luna said, tossing her ball gently to Heidi. 'Playing together is even more fun than playing alone.'\n\n'That's because we're family,' Randy said with his characteristic big smile.\n\n'And family always helps each other,' added Heidi, passing the ball to Morphée.\n\n'Even when it means making hard choices,' Morphée concluded wisely, batting the ball back to Luna.\n\nThat Easter morning, they had found more than just a lost ball. They had discovered that the greatest adventures happen when friends work together, and that the most precious treasures are the ones we share with others.\n\nAs they reached the farmhouse, the warm smell of Easter breakfast drifted from the kitchen windows, and they knew that this would be an Easter they would never forget—not because of the eggs or treats, but because of the love and teamwork that made their family so special.\n\n'Happy Easter, everyone!' Luna barked joyfully.\n\n'Happy Easter!' they all replied together, their voices mixing with the sweet song of spring birds and the gentle morning breeze that rustled through the trees of Sage Farm.",
