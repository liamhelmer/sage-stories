# Redirect old URLs to new structure
RewriteRule ^old-stories/(.*)$ /stories/$1 [R=301,L]

# Handle story URLs
RewriteRule ^story/([a-z0-9\-]+)/?$ /story.php?slug=$1 [L,QSA]

# Handle category URLs
RewriteRule ^stories/category/([a-z0-9\-]+)/?$ /category.php?slug=$1 [L,QSA]

# Handle age group URLs
RewriteRule ^stories/age/([0-9\-]+)/?$ /age-group.php?age=$1 [L,QSA]
```

### Canonical URLs
```html
<!-- Prevent duplicate content issues -->
<link rel="canonical" href="https://sagestories.com/story/the-brave-little-fox">

<!-- Category pages -->
<link rel="canonical" href="https://sagestories.com/stories/category/adventure">

<!-- Paginated content -->

<link rel="prev" href="https://sagestories.com/stories">
<link rel="next" href="https://sagestories.com/stories?page=2">
```
